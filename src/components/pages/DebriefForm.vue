      Thank you for participating in this study conducted by Sumaiya Muhammad.
      We hope you enjoyed the experience. This form provides background about my
      research and elaborates on further details of the study. Please feel free
      to ask any questions or to comment on any aspect of the study.

      The true purpose of the study was to determine the effects of loss
      aversion on your attention and performance in the task. Loss aversion is
      an idea introduced by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. It refers to
      people’s tendencies to prefer avoiding losses to earning equivalent gains.
      I hoped to study whether loss aversion is merely limited to preference or
      if it had effects on one’s attention as well. Participants were thus
      divided into four groups for this study. All participants played the same
      game of pressing the space bar when an X appears on the screen. However,
      the instructions provided to participants were different. Group 1 was told
      to press the button with no mention of losses or gains. Participants in
      group 2 were told they would lose 10 points for each time they failed to
      press the space bar when the X appeared on the screen. Group 3
      participants were told they would earn 10 points for each time they
      correctly pressed the space bar for X. In Group 4, participants were told
      they would earn 10 points for each correct button press and lose 10 points
      for incorrect button presses.

      To protect the integrity of this research, I could not fully divulge the
      details of this study in the beginning. I withheld information from you
      during your participation because I did not want my predictions about the
      research to affect how you performed in the task. It is important that you
      do not share information about this project with your friends or
      classmates. The main reason for this is that your comments could influence
      the expectations, and therefore, the performance of a future participant,
      which would bias the data. I hope you will support my research by keeping
      your knowledge of this study confidential.
